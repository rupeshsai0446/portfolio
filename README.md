# Portfolio_site

## Description

My project Portfolio_site is about an IPL team SUN RISERS HYDERABAD showing  their logo, motive, achievement and team squad.
When we click on the images of the  players then their respective profiles from wikipedia are opened in the same page.

## Review

For building my Portfolio project, I have used the Front end technologies.

I used HTML for creating my website and CSS for displayiong the HTML elements and JAVASCRIPT for showing the images in container.

## Requirements
